Churn Analysis for a teleco company

The challenge was to produce a Churn Analysis i.e to classify customers who are likely to stay with the customer and otherwise. Out of 16k of rows ~4k rows of data is missing.
This deos not include other partially missing data. Data also did not include other components such as tariff plan cost, pay as you go service charges therefore we do not know how 
each customer's total revenue is being calculated.
Each month indicates the month the customer was churned. 1 means churned and 0 means retained. Each month indicates end of the month date. So october would be 31st October.
Data is only present for 3 months - October to December of 2015
